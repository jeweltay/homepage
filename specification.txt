BOOTSTRAP USAGE:
I used Bootstrap 5's responsive grid system (container, row, col-*) for layout structure, navigation components for the responsive navbar, carousel component for the sunset photography gallery, modal components for project details, and utility classes for spacing and alignment to create a mobile-first, professional portfolio website.

JAVASCRIPT USAGE:
I implemented a persistent dark/light mode toggle that saves user preference in localStorage and changes the theme throughout the site, project filtering functionality that shows/hides projects based on category selection, and Bootstrap component initialization for interactive elements like modals and carousels to enhance user experience and site interactivity.
